# Business Decision Intelligence for KPI Analysis and Forecasting
Business decisions are often driven by metrics such as revenue, growth, retention, and customer behavior. In practice, these metrics are usually computed in spreadsheets, explored through ad-hoc analysis, and explained manually in reports or presentations.

This project focuses on building a structured decision intelligence workflow around these common business analyses. Using real transactional data, the system computes core KPIs, tracks how they change over time, and applies statistical and machine learning models to identify trends and potential risks.

The emphasis of the project is on clarity and interpretability. KPI definitions follow spreadsheet-style logic, model outputs are explainable, and results are presented in formats that would be familiar to business and analytics teams, including Excel-based reports and concise written summaries.
