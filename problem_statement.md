# Problem Statement
Business and analytics teams rely on key performance indicators (KPIs), historical trends, and forecasts to evaluate performance and guide decision-making. In practice, this analysis is often performed using spreadsheets and ad-hoc scripts, which can make it difficult to ensure consistency, interpretability, and scalability.

The objective of this project is to build a decision intelligence workflow that combines structured KPI computation, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to support clear and explainable business insights using real transactional data.

The project focuses on answering practical business questions that are commonly faced by analytics, business intelligence, and data science teams.

# Key Business Questions

1) How have core business KPIs (such as revenue, number of transactions, and active users) evolved over time, and are there observable trends or seasonality patterns?

2) Which customer or product segments contribute the most to overall business performance, and how has their contribution changed across time periods?

3) Are there segments or behaviors that indicate declining engagement or increased risk (for example, reduced activity or lower transaction value)?

4) What factors appear to be most strongly associated with changes in revenue or growth, based on historical data and model outputs?

5) Based on past performance, what are reasonable short-term forecasts for key metrics, and what level of uncertainty is associated with these forecasts?

6) How sensitive overall business performance is to changes in key drivers (such as transaction volume or average order value)?

7) Which KPIs or segments should stakeholders prioritize monitoring going forward, based on recent trends and predictive signals?
